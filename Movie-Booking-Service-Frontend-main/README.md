Tech Stack
----------
- Frontend framework: React (hooks + functional components)
- Routing: React Router
- State management: (choose your stack) — Context API / Redux / Zustand (update as appropriate)
- Styling: CSS Modules / Tailwind CSS / Styled Components (update with actual choice)

---

Getting Started
---------------
Follow these steps to run the frontend locally.

Prerequisites
- Node.js >= 16.x (LTS recommended)
- npm >= 8.x or yarn >= 1.22
- Optional: pnpm for faster installs
- A running backend Match Booking API (or mock server)

Installation
```bash
# clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Transyltooniaa/Match-Booking-Service-Frontend.git
cd Match-Booking-Service-Frontend

# install dependencies (choose your package manager)
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
```

Configuration & Environment
---------------------------
Copy the example env file and update values to match your backend API & other keys.

```bash
# copy example
cp .env.example .env
```

Key environment variables (examples — update to match your app):
- REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000/api
- REACT_APP_GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID=G-XXXXXXX
- REACT_APP_ENV=development

If you're using TypeScript, also check tsconfig.json for path aliases.

Available Scripts
-----------------
(Adjust according to your actual package.json scripts)

- npm start / yarn start
  - Start dev server (hot reload)
- npm run build
  - Build production bundles
- npm test
  - Run tests
- npm run lint
  - Run ESLint
- npm run format
  - Run Prettier

Example:
```bash
# start dev server
npm run start

# build for production
npm run build

# run tests
npm run test
```

---

Routing & Pages
---------------
Core pages and flow:
- / (Home) — match gallery, featured matches
- /match/:id — match details, trailer, schedule
- /match/:id/booking — seat selection & showtime selector
- /checkout — booking summary & payment
- /bookings — user booking history (requires auth)
- /auth/login and /auth/register — authentication flows

---

Components & Architecture
-------------------------
Suggested component breakdown (update to actual structure):
- src/
  - components/
    - MovieCard, MovieList, SearchBar, FilterBar
    - SeatMap, Seat, SeatLegend
    - ShowtimePicker, Calendar
    - Header, Footer, Navbar
    - Modal, Toast, Spinner
  - pages/
    - HomePage, MoviePage, BookingPage, CheckoutPage, AuthPages
  - context/ or store/
    - AuthContext, BookingContext
  - services/
    - api.js / api.ts — central API client
  - hooks/
    - useFetch, useDebounce, useAuth
  - utils/
    - price, currency, date-helpers
  - assets/
    - logos, placeholder posters

Design principles:
- Small, focused components
- Reusable UI primitives
- Separation between presentation and data fetching
- Favor hooks for logic reuse

---

State Management
----------------
Options:
- Context + useReducer: simple & lightweight for small apps
- Redux Toolkit: great for predictable global state and devtools
- Zustand / Jotai: minimal, performant alternatives

Auth flow:
- Keep JWT (if used) in memory or secure HttpOnly cookie (preferred)
- Provide AuthContext to secure routes and get user/bookings

---

Styling & Theming
-----------------
- Prefer utility-first (Tailwind) or component-scoped (CSS Modules / Styled Components)
- Provide theme tokens (colors, spacing, typography)
- Support dark mode toggle (optional)
- Accessibility: high contrast, legible font sizes, focus outlines visible

---

Testing
-------
- Unit tests: Jest + React Testing Library for components & hooks
- E2E tests: Cypress / Playwright to simulate booking flows
- Example test command:
```bash
npm test
# or run e2e locally with
npx cypress open
```

Testing tips:
- Mock API responses with MSW (Mock Service Worker)
- Write tests for critical flows: seat selection, booking submission, auth

---

CI & Deployment
----------------
Suggested GitHub Actions workflows:
- lint.yml — run ESLint + Prettier
- test.yml — run unit + e2e tests
- build-and-deploy.yml — build production artifacts and deploy to Netlify / Vercel / GitHub Pages / AWS S3 + CloudFront

Vercel / Netlify:
- Connect repo, set environment variables, and deploy — they will handle builds automatically.

Docker (optional):
- Provide a lightweight node image to serve the build via static server (nginx or serve)

---

Security & Best Practices
-------------------------
- Do not store sensitive secrets in client-side .env files
- Prefer HttpOnly cookies for authentication tokens
- Validate seat availability on the backend before confirming bookings
- Rate-limit critical endpoints on backend to prevent abuse

---

Accessibility Checklist
-----------------------
- Semantic HTML elements for buttons, links, form controls
- Keyboard-accessible seat map & booking steps
- ARIA labels for dynamic regions / modals
- Color contrast ratio above WCAG AA minimum
- Skip-to-content anchor and visible focus states

- help wanted

---

Roadmap
-------
Planned improvements:
- 🎯 Full authentication & user profiles
- 🧾 Real payment integration with Stripe
- 🔔 Email / SMS booking confirmations
- 🕒 Real-time seat locking with websockets
- 🌍 Multi-language support
- 🔍 Advanced search & recommendations using ML

---

FAQ & Troubleshooting
---------------------
Q: The app shows "Failed to fetch" on startup
A: Check REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL in .env and ensure backend is running and CORS is enabled.

Q: Seat map shows stale availability
A: Make sure you refresh seats before checkout and that backend validates availability on booking.

Q: How do I add a new match or showtime?
A: Use the backend admin API or dashboard provided by your Match Booking API. Frontend can be extended with admin pages.
